    # Cache the installation of Poetry itself, e.g. the next step. This
    # prevents the workflow from installing Poetry every time, which can be
    # slow. Note the use of the Poetry version number in the cache key, and
    # the "-0" suffix: this allows you to invalidate the cache manually
    # if/when you want to upgrade Poetry, or if something goes wrong (could be
    # done mildly cleaner by using an environment variable).

    # Install Poetry. You could do this manually, or there are several actions
    # that do this. `snok/install-poetry` seems to be minimal yet complete,
    # and really just calls out to Poetry's default install script, which
    # feels correct. I pin the Poetry version here because Poetry does
    # occasionally change APIs between versions and I don't want my actions to
    # break if it does.
    #
    # The key configuration value here is `virtualenvs-in-project: true`: this
    # creates the venv as a `.venv` in your testing directory, which allows
    # the next step to easily cache it.

    # Now install _your_ project. This isn't necessary for many types of
    # projects -- particularly things like Django apps don't need this. But
    # it's a good idea since it fully-exercises the pyproject.toml and makes
    # that if you add things like console-scripts at some point that they'll
    # be installed and working.
