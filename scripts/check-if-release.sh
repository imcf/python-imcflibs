# Very basic script checking for the existence of a file 'release.properties' in
# the root of the repository. If this is present, the state of the checkout
# indicates this is a proper release made through the 'release-version.sh'
# script from the 'scijava-scripts' repo. Will return false if the file is not
# present, can be overridden with an environment variable.

# The idea is to include this in automated builds to prevent accidential
# attempts of publishing non-releases to PyPI.
